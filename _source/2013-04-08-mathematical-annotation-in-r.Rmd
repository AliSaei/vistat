Want to write mathematical symbols and expressions in R graphics? You can use an R `expression()`
instead of normal text, e.g. `plot(1:10, main = expression(alpha + beta))`. Below is a demo that
shows you everything about plotting math in R:

```{r demo-plotmath, eval=FALSE}
demo(plotmath)
```
```{r read-plotmath, cache=FALSE, include=FALSE}
read_demo('plotmath', package='graphics', labels='plotmath')
```
```{r plotmath, echo=FALSE, results='hide', dpi=90, crop=TRUE}
```
