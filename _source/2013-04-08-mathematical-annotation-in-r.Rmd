A graph with mathematical symbols and formulas are very useful in some cases. R function
`expression` can format mathematical anotations to LaTeX style. Expressions can also be used for
titles, subtitles and x- and y-axis labels (but not for axis labels on persp plots.

## Mathematical annotation in R

```{r demo-plotmath, eval=FALSE}
demo(plotmath)
```

```{r read-plotmath, cache=FALSE, include=FALSE}
read_demo('plotmath', package='graphics', labels='plotmath')
```

```{r plotmath, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
```
