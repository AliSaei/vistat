A root is a value for which a given function equals zero. When that function is plotted on a graph,
the roots are points where the function crosses the x-axis. We learn [Vieta's
formulas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta's_formulas) to solve the [polynomial
equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#Solving_polynomial_equations) at school. But how
does the computer to find the roots? Some scientists have implemented several numerical root-
finding methods to solve the problem.

The numerical [root finding methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-finding_algorithm) use
iteration, producing a sequence of numbers that hopefully converge towards a limit which is a root.

In this article, I will apply the [**animation** package](http://yihui.name/animation)'s function
`bisection.method()` to show you one of the numercical root-finding methods -- the [Bisection
Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-finding_algorithm#Bisection_Method).

Basically, the bisection method finding the root from both sides by making use of the [Intermediate
Value Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem). In essence, this theorem
says that if $$f$$ is a **continous function** on $$[a, b]$$ and the sign of $$f(a)$$ is different
from the sign of $$f(b)$$, then there must be some point $$c$$, in the interval such that
$$f(c)=0$$, and is thus a root of the function.

Here is an example of Bisection Method, the continuous function is
$$f(x)=x{^3}-7x-10$$, the interval is $$[-3,5]$$. The root on the interval is 3.184.


```{r bisection-method, fig.show='animate', interval=2}
library(animation)
ani.options(interval = 2)
par(mar = c(4, 4.5, 2, 1.5))
f = function(x) x^3 - 7 * x - 10
xx=bisection.method(f, c(-3, 5))
xx$root
```
