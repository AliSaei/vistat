In the [**animation** package](http://yihui.name/animation), functions `flip.coin` provides a simulation to the process of flipping coins and computes the frequencies for 'heads' and 'tails'. Coin flipping is a famous [Bernoulli trial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial). When you flip a coin, there are two possible outcomes: heads and tails. A fair coin has the probability of 'heads' 0.5 by definition.

## Head or tail

In this case, we toss a fair coin 100 times.

```{r head-or-tail, fig.show='animate'}
library(animation) 
ani.options(nmax = 100)
par(mar = c(2, 4, 2, 2))
flip.coin(bg = "yellow")
```

## Coin stands

In this case, we set the coin can stands when flipping.

```{r hermann-grid-illusion, fig.show='animate'}
ani.options(nmax = 100)
par(mar = c(2, 4, 2, 2))
flip.coin(faces = c("Head", "Stand", "Tail"), type = "n", prob = c(0.45, 0.1, 0.45), col = c(1, 2, 4))
```
